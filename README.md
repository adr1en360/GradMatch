# GradMatch

GradMatch is a Django-based web application designed to assist students in finding suitable graduate programs based on their academic profiles. It integrates AI capabilities using LangFlow to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Uses LangFlow to process user inputs and generate tailored graduate program suggestions.
- **Dynamic Frontend**: Utilizes HTMX for seamless, dynamic updates without full-page reloads.
- **Customizable Flows**: Easily modify the LangFlow configuration to adapt to different use cases.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.0+
- LangFlow
- HTMX

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GradMatch.git
   cd GradMatch
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
2. Enter your academic profile (e.g., program, GPA, GRE score, research experience).
3. View personalized graduate program recommendations generated by the AI.

## LangFlow Integration

This project uses LangFlow to process user inputs and generate recommendations. The flow configuration is stored in the `Scholary Ai (1).json` file. You can modify this file to customize the AI's behavior.

### Running LangFlow

1. Install LangFlow:
   ```bash
   pip install langflow
   ```

2. Start the LangFlow server:
   ```bash
   langflow run
   ```

3. Ensure the LangFlow server is running at `http://localhost:7860` for the Django app to communicate with it.
